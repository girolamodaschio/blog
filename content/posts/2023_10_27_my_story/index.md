#### üõ†Ô∏è Professionally:
Since  I've started my career 


My role revolves around ensuring that everything runs like a well-oiled machine in the digital landscape. 
I love the challenge of dealing with intricate systems and making sure they work flawlessly and consistently. 
My job is to build, optimize, and maintain the foundation of Smart Process Automation applications in a Cloud Environment.

#### üåü Beyond the Desk:
But there's more to me than just code. In my hometown, I'm a hacktivist, working alongside the city administration on initiatives related to digital innovation. 

It's about using technology to solve local problems and improve the lives of those in our community. I believe that tech has the potential to create a brighter future for us all on matters of education, empowerment, and transparency.
