My name is Girolamo, I'm writing from Vicenza where I work, remotely, as a Backend Engineer.

I started my career in audiovisual production, but then Covid changed the world, I could not film anymore and I discovered my passion for Software development.

After attending a training in Python on Datacamp I've landed an apprenticeship at an IT Consultancy Firm where I collaborate with a brilliant team of Smart Process Automation Engineers.

But there's more to me than just code. In my hometown, I'm a hacktivist, working alongside the city administration on initiative related to digital innovation.
