I'm Girolamo, writing from Vicenza (IT) where I work, remotely, as a Backend Engineer.
I've started my career in audiovisual production, then Covid changed the world and I've discovered my passion in software engineering.
After attending a training in Python on Datacamp I've landed at an IT consultancy Company where I work as SRE collaborating with a brilliant team of Smart Process Automation Engineers.

🛠️ Professionally:
My role as an SRE revolves around ensuring that everything runs like a well-oiled machine in the digital landscape. 
I love the challenge of dealing with intricate systems and making sure they work flawlessly and consistently. 
My job is to build, optimize, and maintain the foundation of your applications.

🌟 Beyond the Desk:
But there's more to me than just code. In my hometown, I'm a hacktivist, working alongside the city administration on initiatives related to digital innovation. 
It's about using technology to solve local problems and improve the lives of those in our community. I believe that tech has the potential to create a brighter future for us all.
