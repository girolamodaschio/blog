# Hello world :)

I used to be a VR movie Producer and Director. 🎬 Doing this, I had to manage the actor's emotions to help the viewer to discover more about the world we live in. 🪐

After finishing my Data Science apprenticeship at Datacamp 🇺🇸, I found myself managing, analyzing and interpreting big data that could help us to discover more about the world surrounding us. 🗺

I'm currently working as Analyst Consultant at Capgemini.🪁I used to be a VR movie Producer and Director. 🎬 Doing this, I had to manage the actor's emotions to help the viewer to discover more about the world we live in. 🪐 After finishing my Data Science apprenticeship at Datacamp 🇺🇸, I found myself managing, analyzing and interpreting big data that could help us to discover more about the world surrounding us. 🗺 I'm currently working as Analyst Consultant at Capgemini.🪁
